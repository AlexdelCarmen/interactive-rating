## My process

Started off by creating the HTMl structure and applying all styles for both cards, next I applied vanilla JavaScript to make the rating interactive, finally some tweaks via media query to ensure responsiveness. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

forEach, I have seen the function here and there on a couple of tutorials, but had to apply it on my own here to get event listeners applied to all the 5 rating buttons. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
ratings.forEach((rating) =>
  rating.addEventListener("click", (e) => {
    ratings.forEach((rating) => rating.classList.remove("rate-selected"));
    e.target.classList.toggle("rate-selected");
  })
);

```

### Continued development

I was still not able to gauge colors perfectly this time around, but getting better on sizes, my usage of the classList.toggle needs to improve too. 

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - I used W3Schools to check on how to use forEach.
